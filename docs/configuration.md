# TesseraCT Configuration

This file explains how to configure TesseraCT.

It contains two main parts:

 1. [Chain lifecyle](#chain-lifecycle): with settings impacting how submission
 are processed
 2. [Setup](#setup): with instructions on how to setup TesseraCT resources

## Chain lifecycle

When TesseraCT receives a new chain submission, it is first
[filtered](#chain-filtering), and is then sent to the Tessera library where it goes
through the [Append Lifecycle](#append-lifecycle).
The chain may be [deduplicated using TesseraCT's and Tessera's antispam features](#antispam).

### Chain filtering

Chains accepted by TesseraCT can be filtered by setting the following flags:

- `root_pem_file`: Path to a file containing root certificates that are
acceptable to the log. Chains MUST be signed by one of the roots included in
this file.
- `reject_expired`: If true, TesseraCT rejects expired certificates.
- `reject_unexpired`: If true, TesseraCT rejects certificates that are either
currently valid or not yet valid.
- `ext_key_usage`: A list of comma separated [Extended Key Usages (EKU) from x509](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/x509#ExtKeyUsage).
Certificates MUST include one or more of these EKUs to be accepted. If empty, no
filtering is applied.
- `reject_extension`: A comma separated list of X.509 extension OIDs, in dotted
string form (e.g. `2.3.4.5`). Certificates that include one or more of these extensions
will be rejected.
- `not_after_start`: Start of the range of acceptable NotAfter values,
inclusive. Leaving this unset or empty implies no lower bound to the range.
RFC3339 UTC format, e.g: `2024-01-02T15:04:05Z`.
- `not_after_limit`: Cut off point of NotAfter dates - only notAfter dates
strictly _before_ `not_after_limit` will be accepted. Leaving this unset or empty
means no upper bound on the accepted range. RFC3339 UTC format, e.g:
`2024-01-02T15:04:05Z`.

### Append lifecycle

Tessera stages entries submitted via `Add`, then [sequences them in a batch](#sequencing-batch)
to assign them with a durable sequence number. Asynchronously from this, entries
are first integrated into the log (i.e durably written into the log together with
hashes committing to them), and then [published every checkpoint interval](#checkpoint-interval)
(i.e a checkpoint which index covers these entries is published). TesseraCT
can [wait for the full process to be done](#publication-awaiter) before sending
responses to clients.

#### Sequencing Batch

The `batch_max_age` and `batch_max_size` flags control the maximum age and number
of entries in a single [sequencing batch](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tessera?tab=readme-ov-file#sequencing).
These flags affect the overall performance of TesseraCT. The correct values for
these flags depend on multiple factors, such as the driver used, the number
of TesseraCT servers or their steady QPS rate. Defaults values have been chosen sensibly
and should be fine to get started with, but we invite you to experiment with values
tailored to your setup.

#### Checkpoint Interval

The `checkpoint_interval` flag controls the interval duration between two
checkpoint publications. Due to constraints imposed by underlying storage
systems, this interval has a lower limit. Tessera ensures that the configured
interval is larger than any such lower limit during the initialization process.

| Backend | Minimum Permitted Checkpoint Interval (ms) |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| AWS     | 1000                                       |
| GCP     | 1200                                       |

Note that when used in conjunction with `enable_publication_awaiter`, `checkpoint_interval`
directly impacts `add-*` requests response time.

#### Publication Awaiter

The `enable_publication_awaiter` flag enables [Tessera's publication awaiter](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tessera?tab=readme-ov-file#synchronous-publication):
when this flag is on, TesseraCT responds to `add-*` requests only after a
`checkpoint` committing to that entry has been published. When this flag is off,
TesseraCT responses to `add-*` requests as soon as Tessera has durably assigned a
sequence number to the corresponding entry. Such entries would then get integrated
and published asynchronously, which might happen before TesseraCT responses to the
`add-*` request are sent, or after.

While this flag provides extra guarantees to clients, it will likely lead to a
lower a log throughput, an increased number of open sockets open, and of RAM
used. Make sure that the `http_deadline` flag leaves enough time for requests
to be fully processed.

This flag is on by default.

### Antispam

The `pushback_max_antispam_lag`, `pushback_max_dedupe_in_flight` and
`inmemory_antispam_cache_size` flags control how [TesseraCT's Antispam
feature](./architecture.md#antispam) works, which itself is built on top of
[Tessera's Antispam](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tessera?tab=readme-ov-file#antispam)
capabilities. It is composed of three main steps:

1. A process **asynchronous** with `add-*`, populating the antispam databases
with entry indices as the log grows. This is handled by Tessera.
2. A call **synchronous** with **all** `add-*` to the antispam database to
identify if the entry submitted is a duplicate of a previous one. This is
handled by Tessera.
3. If this entry is a duplicate, a last call **synchronous** with this duplicate
`add-*` call fetches the entry from the log to extract the information required
to build its SCT. This is handled by TesseraCT.

The `pushback_max_antispam_lag` flag controls the limit of how far behind the
current size of the tree the asynchronous process in `(1)` can fall.
When this value is exceeded, TesseraCT returns `429 - Too Many Requests` to
**all** `add-*` requests. This protects TesseraCT from accepting new entries
without being able to tell whether they are duplicates of recently integrated
entries.

The `inmemory_antispam_cache_size` flag controls the number of recently-added
entries which indexes are kept in memory.  This both makes subsequent some `(2)`
calls faster, and provides optimistic coverage for entries submitted _very_
recently and which have not yet been processed by the asynchronous process in
`(1)`.

The `pushback_max_dedupe_in_flight` flag rate limits how many concurrent `add-*`
requests identified as duplicates will be processed by the
**synchronous** process in `(3)` wich fetches entries and extracts information
required to build SCTs. When this value is exceeded, TesseraCT returns
`429 -Too Many Requests` to subsequent **duplicate** `add-*` requests only.
Non-duplicate `add-*` requests are not impacted, and can still be processed.
This limits the amount of resources TesseraCT spends on servicing duplicate
requests.

## Setup

### Origin and submission prefix

The origin used in Checkpoints is specified with the `origin` flag, and should
be derived from the submission prefix for the log as explained below.

The submission prefix of a log has two parts, the host and the serving path:
`https://$HOST/$PATH_PREFIX/ct/v1/...`.

As per [static-ct-api specs](https://c2sp.org/static-ct-api):
> the origin line
MUST be the submission prefix of the log as a schema-less URL with no trailing
slashes.

Use your upstream serving infrastructure to make sure that requests to these
URLs are correctly routed to a TesseraCT server. TesseraCT will serve the
requests it receives regardless of their `$HOST`. However, it will expect
requests to be received on `$PATH_PREFIX`, as specified by the `path_prefix` flag.

### Memory considerations

TesseraCT's memory footprint is directly impacted by:

- `inmemory_antispam_cache_size`: the number of recently-added entries which indexes
are kept in memory
- `batch_max_size`: the number of entries that are kept in memory before
sequenced in a batch
- [The number of cached issuers keys](https://github.com/transparency-dev/tesseract/blob/main/storage/storage.go)
- `enable_publication_awaiter` and `http_deadline`: they impact the number of
concurent requests, hence the amount of RAM being used

### Frontend redundancy

For added availability multiple TesseraCT instances can run concurrently with the
same Tessera resources. Adding more instances will not necessarily increase
performance, the primary goal of concurrency is to allow for better
availability.

Multiple TesseraCT server can run concurrently on AWS or GCP. It is also
possible to run concurrent servers with the POSIX and Vanilla S3 + MySQL
implementations, **but** this will depend on the underlying storage systems
being used.

### Running multiple logs

To run multiple logs, run multiple TesseraCT instances configured with different
Tessera resources. For simplicity, it is not possible to serve multiple logs
from a single TesseraCT instance.

## Platform specific configuration

### AWS

TesseraCT expects the databases configured with the `db_name` and
`antispam_db_name` flags to be located in the same Aurora DB cluster.

### GCP

#### VM

By default, TesseraCT exports OpenTelemetry metrics and traces to GCP
infrastructure. It is not currently possible to opt-out of this.

When running TesseraCT on a GCE VM, OpenTelemetry exporters
[need to be configured manually with a project ID](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/opentelemetry-operations-go/blob/main/exporter/metric/README.md#authentication).
Set this project ID via the `otel_project_id` flag. This is not required when
TesseraCT does not run on a VM.

When running multiple instances of TesseraCT from the terminal, run
`export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.instance.id=$VALUE"` with a different
`$VALUE` for each instance.
