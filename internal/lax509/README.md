# lax509

This is a minimalist fork of [`crypto/x509`](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/x509).

As specified by [RFC6962 S3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6962#section-3.1),
CT logs MUST validate sumbmitted chains to ensure that they link up to roots
they accept. `crypto/x509` implements this, and also runs additional common
chain validation checks. However, these additional checks:

- Do not allow chains to contain precertificates or preissuers intermediates.
- Would block non compliant certificates signed by production roots from being
accepted, therefore preventing them from becoming transparency discoverable.

The fork in this directory implements chain verification requirements from
[RFC6962 S3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6962#section-3.1) and disables
some additional check, such as:

- **Handling of critical extensions**: CT precertificates are identified by a
critical extension defined in [RFC6962 S3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6962#section-3.1),
 which the `crypto/x509` library does not process. A non-processed critical
 extension would fail certificate validation. This check is disabled to allow
 precertificate in the logs.
- **Cert expiry**: `notBefore` and `notAfter` certificate checks are handled at
submission time, based on the `notBeforeLimit` and `notAfterLimit` log
parameters. Therefore, not only we don't need to check them again at certificate
verification time, but we specifically want to accept all certificates within
the `[notBeforeLimit, notAfterLimit]` range, even if they have expired.
- **CA name restrictions**: an intermediate or root certificate can restrict the
domains it can issue certificates for. This check is disabled to make such
issuances discoverable.
- **Chain length**: this check is confused by chains including preissuer intermediates.
- **Extended Key Usage**: this would ensure that all the EKU of a child
certificate are also held by its parents. However, the EKU identifying preissuer
intermediate certs in [RFC6962S3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6962#section-3.1)
does not need to be set in the issuing certificate, so this check would not pass
for chains using a preissuer intermediate. Also, see <https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24590>.
- **Policy graph validation**: chains that violate policy validation should be
discoverable through CT logs.

Disabling additional checks:

- Negative serial numbers are not allowed starting from go1.23. To allow
   them, set `x509negativeserial=1` in the GODBUG environment variable, either
   in your terminal at build time or with `//go:debug x509negativeserial=1` at
   the top of your main file.
